  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>Welcome to my bio page. Hello My name is Michael Nguyen. I am currently a student as a computer engineer major working to get my Bachelors degree. I am from Boston, Massachusetts and lived there for about 15 years before I moved to California to continue the rest of my education. It has been about 6 to 7 years of living in Southern California. My family consist of 4 people, my parents, my sister, and myself. My father currently works as an HR at a company that makes circuit boards for NASA and SpaceX. My mother owns her own hair salon and my sister is graduating this year as a international business major. Throughout the years, I have grown to have lots of hobbies when I'm home, such as custom mechanical keyboards, plastic model kits, building custom PCs, and many more. I also enjoy watching anime shows and movies and other types as well. I also love reading webcomics and manga.</p>
